# Discord RPC for YouTube Music 

I was always jealous of my friends who used Spotify because they could show off their impeccable taste in music for the world to see on Discord, while I was forced to enjoy my music all alone.

*Until now!*

# Installing



# How it Works

The userscript watches YouTube music for updates via the [Media Session API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Session_API) and relays them to the local app by making an HTTP request to a webserver running on `localhost:19347`. When the app receives an update, it updates your Discord activity.

# Should you use this?

No. Go use [PreMid](https://premid.app/), it's better.
